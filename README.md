# Y&M Studios — Yoga & Mindfulness Booking System

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- npm installed

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
npm install

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root using `.env.example` as a template.
   Open `.env` and set your own `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` value.

3. Seed the database with demo data:
node seed/seed.js

This creates two demo accounts:
   - Student: `fiona@student.local` / `student123`
   - Organiser: `organiser@yoga.local` / `organiser123`

4. Start the server:
node index.js

5. Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000
